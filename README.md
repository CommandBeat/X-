# X-
This is a programming language that **I** created.

# LICENSE
Here is a list of things you **HAVE** do with this.
1. When posting edited `X-` code, you have to credit me  
That's it.

# INSTRUCTIONS
To use `X-`, you first have to make a .xminus project!  

1. Make a program in your .xminus file

Here is some example snippets of .xminus code:
(COMMENTS **HAVEN'T** BEEN ADDED YET)
```
log("X- is awesome!")

var = "X- code is really good."
log(var)
hi = 1 + 1
```
I know it's not much but it's a *Work In Developement(WIP)*

2. Type in your console, run {your project name}.xminus  
That's all you need to do!
